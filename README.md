Project Rail source code

This is a really old project and contains a deprecated datastructure. Don't use as guide.


Basically this project was one of the first Technical Computing projects in my IT study. 
Project RAIL was a complex and big project. The aim of the project was to create a prototype of a Personal Rapid Transit(PRT) System. A PRT system is a system where multiple vehicles without driver transport people/merchandise from A to B. Part of the project was to create a simulation (which is included in the src). The system we build had to be scalable to a large city. We used the A* algorithm to calculate the best path for the PRTs. The system also included parking spots for unused PRTs. All PRTs were called via an Android application, their location(street) was visible via a tablet in the PRT itself.
